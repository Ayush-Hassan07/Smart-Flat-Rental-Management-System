# Smart-Flat-Rental-Management-System
1. Project Title : Smart Flat Rental Management System 
2. Problem Statement
Finding rental flats in urban areas of Bangladesh, especially in cities like Dhaka and Chattogram, is a challenging and time-consuming process. Many tenants rely on brokers, who often charge high fees, and landlords struggle to find reliable tenants. Additionally, the lack of a centralized rental database leads to miscommunication, fraudulent listings, and difficulty in comparing rental options. This project aims to develop a web-based system that connects tenants, landlords, and real estate agents to streamline the rental process efficiently.
3. Objectives
Develop a centralized platform for listing, searching, and managing rental flats.
Provide real-time updates on available flats with detailed descriptions and images.
Enable direct communication between landlords and tenants without intermediaries.
Offer secure digital agreements and rental payment tracking.
Integrate a location-based search feature to help tenants find flats in preferred areas.

4. Proposed Solution
Technology Stack
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Bootstrap for responsive design)
Backend: PHP (for server-side logic)
Database: MySQL (for storing user data, property listings, rental agreements, and payment records)

Core Features 
i) Tenant Portal: Allows users to search for flats based on location, price, and amenities.
ii) Landlord Dashboard: Enables landlords to list properties, manage tenant requests, and track payments.
iii) Real-Time Notifications: Updates tenants and landlords on new listings, requests, and payment reminders.
iv) Digital Rental Agreements: Secure e-agreements to formalize rental deals.
v) Map-Based Search: Integration with Google Maps to locate flats based on user preferences.
vi) Review & Rating System: Tenants and landlords can leave feedback to enhance transparency.

Innovative Aspects 
Incorporate filtering options for providing smart recommendations based on user preferences.
Verified listings to prevent fraudulent property postings. Like letting a landlord verify tenants by their NID before renting out a flat.
Secure online rental payment options.
Eliminating the need for brokers through a direct landlord-tenant connection as the platform will be free for all and no commission will be applied.
